            <p>I'm currently a fourth year at the University of Iowa. I grew up very close, in Ely, Iowa. I attended elementary through high school at Solon. Growing up I've always enjoyed math and reading a good book!</p>
            <p>At the University of Iowa I'm majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I chose this major while in high school. I took a class at Kirkwood community college during my senior year over C++ and Matlab and loved programming. That class showed me that this was what I wanted to study.</p>
            <p>I'm still unsure about what I want to do in my future. Currently I'm taking a class, Modern Databases, where we've worked in PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, and Redis. I've enjoyed working with these databases and have thought about looking into a data analysis job.</p>
